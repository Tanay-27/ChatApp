# ChatApp
A NodeJS and MongoDB real time chat application.
This is my first attempt at Nodejs as well as mongodb

### To check the live demonstration of the project:- 
https://alastairschatroom.herokuapp.com/

### Few basic concepts that have been tried are
- Different aspect ratios for mobile and web screens
- Auto scrolling when message is sent/recieved
- Enter button to send
- Clear button to delete all messages
- Clearing textbox on send
- Justify and allign the textbox

### Working
User has the choice to enter his/her name.
When the user presses send button the text is sent to database. Once appended the database is searched for new messages and loading them into the div container.
This makes sure the sent message is visible in the messages list only if it has been successfully sent.

Looking forward to collabourate
